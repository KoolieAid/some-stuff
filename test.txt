Millions of years ago, we all have one Philosophy in common, and that is to survive. As the years pass by, we develop cultures and reasoning. Now, people tend to have different perspectives and personalities. Sometimes, they could misinterpret the message given because of their culture, and because of how they adapted the personalities of their ancestors. If a person gave right message but with a wrong response, the receiver might consider it as a threat, for they might have a background on the response. 
At this time, we should learn how to give right responses than to give right messages. Though context is extremely important, but other people might interpret the context in a different manner such as taking it as a threat. People should be learning how to respond in a proper way to not offend anyone, because our world changed overtime and we should also change. If we have tried to give the right responses, we may discover the essential ingredient to effective cross-cultural communication- giving the right responses.
